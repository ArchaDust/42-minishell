# 42-minishell
Simple bash reimplementation in group

Grade: 99/100  
Teammates: tnguyen-

This is the code as it was upon closing the project and correcting it. There are a few minor issues that I have decided to leave as-is.

# 99 ? Come on what happened ?  
It's quite funny: after our first failed push, I went back to the code to fix a few issues, one being something akin to `$$`, incorrectly handled  
My very quick and poorly tested fix broke `$?` which as you may know is quite essential to testing our program's behavior  
Thankfully this wasn't detrimental to the overall grade, and it was an easy fix
